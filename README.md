# Finding evidence of cheating in MLB broadcast audio

 ## Work In Progress!!!! Analysis, better documentation, and metadata to be commited soon.

## Preface
**background** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros_sign_stealing_scandal

What struck me the most while watching the Astros sign stealing cheating scandal unfold was, in restrospect, how blatantly obvious the sign stealing came through in the TV broadcasts. Its just hard to imagine that not one baseball fan spotted the trash can banging for well over a year. It seems that in a world of sabermetrics and online sports betting, the sounds and buzz of the stadium are still sacred.

The bigger question I want to explore is how machine learning can be leveraged to catch instances of cheating in sports. Given that this cheating scandal happened right in front of our eyes, I wouldn't be surprised if we can find similar past cheating instances that blew right past our ears.



### TL;DR.

I used a Convolutional Neural Net to search for evidence of cheating in the MLB broadcast audio data. The model was able to identify instances of cheating without any specific training on trash can bangs sounds.

### Results
*input_1 is a 128x106 image of the mel-spectrogram of the audio data prior to the pitch*

*input_2 is the metadata for the pitch. For this specific model I have only included the batter and the month of the game being played.*
![Model Diagram](/trained_models/model_diagram.png)

Since the the audio and the metadata are expected to contain **no** valuable information about the pitch about to be thrown, we should not expect a good generalized model to learn anything. A model that *shows* learning, however, may indicate cheating. In the case of the 2017 Astros, audio cues(i.e. trash can banging) would indeed let the model learn.

two caveats that may not indicate cheating:
- the announcers may say the pitch type out load if they are aware of whats coming next
- the model may learn from the presence of a bat sound if a player is more succesfull with a certain type of pitch.

NOTE:training loss is higher than validation loss because of the way tensorflow calculates loss at different stages of the epoch as well as as dropout.

When plotting a histogram of the predictions we see a clear clustering of a small percentage of pitches with high value predictions.

The "bang" is seen in all of these audio spectrograms as the triangular shape at the bottom of each image. Some have more than 1 bang.

#### Steps
- Data Preparation
   - Image Data
      - Scrape MLB.com for at-bat videos and pitch information
      - Strip out audio from video clips
      - denoise the wav audio
      - Generate mel-spectrograms
   - Meta Data
      - one-hot encode batters
      - create labels using 
- Model Training
  - Split dataset into training and test datasets
  - Fit C-NN and optimize hyperparameters
  - validate model outputs
- Model Inference
  - Use SHAP to explain which part of the spectrogram contributed most towards the cheating predictions
- Analysis
  - placeholder
- Future Work
  - Repeat this analysis on other teams' broadcasts using some combination of swings/hits/pitch type as a proxy for potential cheating opportunities.
  - If the above is successful, repeat using broadcast image data rather than audio data.


## The Data

*TODO: oops! I missed a couple of players! I'll be adding them shortly.*

After scraping MLB.com I compiled a dataframe of pitch data and video links
| pitch_num |pitch_type| zone | speed | batter | pitcher       | date       | count      | inning | pitch_result | pa_result     | video_id                                          |
